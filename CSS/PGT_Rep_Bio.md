## PGT Rep
The role of the PGT Rep is to represent the PGTs within the society and also try to get them to engage with the society. Its a tricky job because they are only with us for one year so its hard to get them to engage within the society, however you will be in charge of trying to engage with them during freshers week so its a perfect opportunity to show off how great CSS is to them. 

As there will be new PGTs next year, you will only be PGT Rep until the November EGM early next year when a new PGT Rep will be elected, which gives you plenty of time to try out being on committee but not have to dedicate to it for a whole year. 

You do not need to be a Postgrad in order to be PGT Rep, as I myself am only a second year so anyone can still run for it which I would definitely recommend if you have enough free time to do so. It is very rewarding and will also let you meet new people as well as help improve team skills and will look good on a CV :wink:

If you have any questions feel free to reach out and I'll be happy to answer :)
