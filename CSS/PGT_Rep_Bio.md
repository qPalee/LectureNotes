## PGT Rep
The role of the PGT Rep is to represent the PGTs within the society and also try to get them to engage with the society. Its a tricky job because they are only with us for one year so its hard to get them to engage within the society. 

You do not need to be a Postgrad in order to be PGT Rep, I was in my second year when I was in the role last year, but I would highly recommend any PGTs to run for the role.

Outside of the specific responsibilities, you will also be helping out with other random tasks that need doing throughout the year, which usually includes filling out forms, publicity, and any other odd bits and bobs that need doing when other people are busy.

I would highly recommend anyone interested to run for committee, whether its this role or another one, as it can be great fun and it's nice to help out.

It is a quieter role than some of the others but it still does have a reasonable time commitment so make sure you have enough free time spare before you consider running!

If you have any questions feel free to reach out and I'll be happy to answer :)
