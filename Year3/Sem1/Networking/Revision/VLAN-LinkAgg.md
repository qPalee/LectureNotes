# VLANs
VLANs let you have multiple networks delivered over a single cable

Implemented by using the optional 'tag' on ethernet frames
VLANs also offer redundancy if you have multiple cables with networks running over both of them

You can use VLANs to logically divide switches

# Link Aggregation
Basically groups multiple physical links into one logical interface

# Combination 
You can combine both of them together and have two or more networks over two or more cables, with load balancing and failover

# Load Balancing
Multiple systems sharing load directed to one IP addresses in one location
