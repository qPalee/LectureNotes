# Introduction
A function in mathematics is something that takes an input and gives an output
If you run a function several times you get the same output every time
Functions do not modify its arguments - the old thing is not changed

Haskell is a call by need language - <span style="color:#00bfff">will be discussed in week 3</span>
Haskell is also a lazy language - only evaluated when needed
Haskell has static typing
- Types which are checked at compile-time
- <span style="color:#00bfff">Will be discussed in week 4</span>

Week 1 will just be going over Haskell
Week 2 we will be doing $\lambda$-calculus
Week 3 will be operational semantics
Week 4 will be type systems - type checking/inference
Week 5 will be abstraction

Monday + Thursday will be more formal lectures
Friday is more of a 'tutorial' usually

2 assignments - similar to exercise sheets (not programming)
- First one is a practice assignment
- Second one is a graded assignment (20%)

### Haskell
A haskell program must have a main function as a top level definition
Types in Haskell don't determine termination - this is an issue with recursion
