# Consensus Problems

Consensus Problems are problems in which a collection of distributed processors are required to reach a common decision
- This is true even if there are initial differences in opinion

### Reaching Consensus in a Distributed System
Each process in the network begins with na initial value of a particular type and will output a value of the same type

All outputs are required to be the same

When there are no failures, this problem is quite trivial however problems arise when there is failures
