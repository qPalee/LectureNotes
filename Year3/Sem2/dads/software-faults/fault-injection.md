# Fault Injection
<span style="color:#ff0000">Not on exam</span>

Fault Injection analysis is subjecting a system to abnormal conditions so that behaviour can be assessed

This is done to test the effectiveness of fault tolerance mechanisms

Can be performed during:
- <span style="color:#00bfff">Design</span> - CAD used to evaluate design
- <span style="color:#00bfff">Testing</span> - Feedback provided based on analysis of units

### Parameter Estimation
Data from fault injection and/or operational systems can be used to identify potential faults or undetected error
