# Dependability Attributes
People often use these terms intermittently

Different domains have different attributes
- Safety-critical domains need high reliability
- Internet Services need high availability

All attributes are equal but some attributes are more equal than others

### Reliability
Probability of a system to correct services over a specified time period
- For example, an aircraft needs high reliability during flights but you don't care quite so much when it is inactive on the ground

Its maths o'clock
