A system is dependable if it is trustworthy enough for reliance to be justifiably placed on the service it delivers

The rate of dependability required for trustworthiness depends on the systems uses

To develop dependable systems we need to:
Have a <span style="color:#00bfff">system model</span>
- how we view our system
- define things like how/what/when they can communicate

Define a <span style="color:#00bfff">fault model</span>
- What are the problems we must consider
- What can go wrong (apollo 13)
- What we do to make a system dependable depends on what issue can occur

The system has a <span style="color:#00bfff">specification</span>
- Oracle for system behaviour
- Defines what a system *should* do
- Defines 2 core components and terminates
	- Safety, nothing bad happening and eventually something good will happen

### System Model
A system is a set of elements that work together to provide service to a user
- Elements can be hardware, software, user etc

Elements interact in a well defined way via well defined interfaces

#### Services
A service is the behaviour that a person perceives at the system interface
Services need to be correct and timely

#### Problems
Elements may start failing
- services not provided as expected
