# Risks

<span style="color:#00bfff">Hazard level</span> is the combination of hazard severity and likelihood of occurrence

Risk is a hazard level combined with:
- Likelihood of hazard leading to accidents
- Hazard exposure or duration

### Safety Cases
Highly critical systems need certification from authority before the start of operation

Not meant to be a formal document - explains how risks have been mitigated

#### Terms for safety cases
- <span style="color:#00bfff">Clear</span> - Be convincing to an informed reader
- <span style="color:#00bfff">Argument</span> - how an informed reader could conclude that a system is safe
- <span style="color:#00bfff">System</span> - Must refer to the specific system
- <span style="color:#00bfff">Acceptably</span> - Acceptable safety is taken with respect to risk levels
- <span style="color:#00bfff">Context</span> - Context-free safety is impossible and acceptable safety is situational

There are three versions of a safety case which should all be developed:
- **Preliminary safety case**
- **Interim safety case**
- **Operational safety case**
