# Revision Lecture
Split the module into 3 groups
- Concepts, Analysis, Software Fault Tolerance
- Leader Election, Consensus, Byzantine Generals
- Clocks, Links + Detectors, Broadcast Algorithms

Vibes i got from the lecture
- URB Algorithm
- Broadcast Algos are 'worth your time'
- Learning link properties are 'underrated'
- Clocks were mentioned a couple times
