# Steps for DPA on AES
- Choose an Intermediate Result of the Algorithm
- Measure power consumption
- Predict Intermediate Values
- Map Intermediate Values to Power Consumption Values
- Compare hypothetical power consumption values with power traces


# Traces required for SNR
$$n = \frac{1}{\rho^2}$$
