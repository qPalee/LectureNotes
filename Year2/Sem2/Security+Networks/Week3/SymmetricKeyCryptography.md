# Symmetric Key Cryptography

##### Kerckhoff's principle: second rule
System should not require secrecy. Algorithms of Alice and Bob are public information

It is called a symmetric key because both parties have the same secret key

### Historic cryptography
The oldest cryptography is the <span style="color:#00bfff">Caesar Cipher</span>
Works by picking a number between 1-26 and using that number as the key

This can be broken by using <span style="color:#00bfff">frequency analysis</span>

For sufficiently long ciphertext, a shift by a fixed length maintains the same relative frequency, so you can calculate 

Binary encryption uses xor due to it being addition modulo 2
