# Bayes' Theorem
### Formula
Given 2 random variables $X$ and $\theta$:
$$p(\theta | X)=\frac{p(\theta) \space p(X|\theta)}{p(X)}$$

$$\text{Posterior distribution}=\frac{\text{prior distribution x likelihood function}}{\text{marginal likelihood}}$$

#### Marginal Likelihood
<span style="color:#ff0000">NOT IN EXAM</span>
Marginal likelihood represents the probability of generating the observed sample for all possible values of the parameters, that is the probability itself, or the evidence in favour of the model, so its known as model evidence or simple evidence
