Mutual Information measures the information that S and Y share and how knowing more about one variable removes uncertainty the other. Since there is a low Mutual Information between the variables, there is a high amount of uncertainty between them so i dont think this feature will be selected

Mutual Information tells us how much knowing about one variable can tell us about another variable, basically a high mutual information means they share information alot and knowing alot about one variable will reduce uncertainty about the other.
