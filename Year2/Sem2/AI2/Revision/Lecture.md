# Revision
No more than 2 equation in the main exam

All the probability distribution function will <span style="color:#ff0000">NOT</span> be assessed

Except from last years papers, all the relevant past paper questions are on the exercise sheets

### Shan He goat
#### Week 1
Need to know what argmax is - especially the meaning
- Choose a value of theta which maximises output

Try to understand whole concept of maximum likelihood - will be helpful

#### Week 2
##### Lecture 1
Logistic regression is a statistical coup for classification problems

Need to know how to calculate <span style="color:#00bfff">odds</span> and <span style="color:#00bfff">logit</span>
Use base log e (ln) since its easier on calculator

Calculate probability from odds

Need to know how to interpret the result
- What does it mean

##### Lecture 2
Only 3 important slides

<span style="color:#00fc00">Dont need to remember equation on slide 9</span>


#### Week 3
##### Lecture 1
Need to remember Entropy 
Need to remember entropy equations
Entropy is similar to joint and conditional probability

Mutual information
- Don't need to remember equation since you can use entropies to calculate it
- Need to remember how to calculate it though

Learn how to do the exercise on slides

#### Week 4
Bayes theorum not in exam
Proability calculation might be in exam though

#### Week 5
Spend more time on this topic
Probabilistic machine learning

For exam only need to pay attention to lecture 2 slides - representation (slides 8-11)


Learn equation 2 to be able to calculate it
- Product of the local conditional distributions

### Omg new guy
I dont understand what bossman is saying
#### Search

##### Constraint Satisfaction Problem (CSP)
CSP is a special class of search problems which can be formally represented and allows useful general purpose search strategies

CSP is a subset of identification problems

A CSP consists of
- Set of variables
- Domain for each variable
- Set of constraints

A constraint graph is used to represent relations between constraints in a CSP where nodes correspond between variables and arcs reflect the constraints
- Need to know how to draw constraint graph

###### Example of CSP - Map colouring problem
Paint the aussie map with 3 colours in such a way that no adjacent regions can habve the same colour

Variables - Different states (WA, NT, Q, NSW, V, SA, T)
Domain - Different colours (red, green, blue)
Constriants - different states which cant be the same colour

###### Strategies to solve CSPs
