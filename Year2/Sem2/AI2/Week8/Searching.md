# Searching
Search is not about prediction, but bout choice and decision making such as planning and assigning

### State Space graph
A mathematical representation of a search problem
- Nodes represent states
- Arcs represent transitions

### Search Tree
The process of solving the search problem can be abstracted as a search tree
- The start state is the root node
- Children correspond to successors
- Nodes show states but correspond to plans that achieve those states
