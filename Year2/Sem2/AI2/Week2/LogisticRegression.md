# Logistic Regression

Logistic Regression is a regression model where the prediction is <span style="color:#00bfff">binary</span>
- The goal is to predict the probability that a given example belongs to the '1' class versus the probability that it belongs to the '0' class
- Done using either the <span style="color:#00bfff">logarithm of the odds</span> or the <span style="color:#00bfff">logistic function</span>

Logistic regression is still very useful, even when a simple version is used

A logistic regression can also be seen as a simple neural network with no hidden layers

### Assumptions of Logistic Regression
- Binary Outcomes
- Independent observations - shouldn't come from repeated measurements
- Low or no <span style="color:#00fc00">multicollinearity</span> among independent variables - variables are too highly correlated
- Linearity of independent variables + log odds
- A large sample size - need at least 10 cases with the least frequent outcome for each independent variable
