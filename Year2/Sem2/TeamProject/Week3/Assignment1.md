### Submission for Assessment 1
We could decide to make up people if we wanted
Up to team to decide rankings (worth doing)
<span style="color:#ff0000">NOT</span> a website, its a web app - not static
\Avoid targeting specific features for specific disabilities
Don't try to make it too general - as specific as possible, can add more if needed
One reasonable large feature per user, reasonably complicated

Marks are not affected by rank, as long as team is happy
If nothing is submitted then marks will be affected

#### App idea feedback
Don't rely on lots of user contribution - not enough user data to make interesting
Don't rely on lots of data entry

Why should users use our app over the alternative?
How/When do we get started with development?
