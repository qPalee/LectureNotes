# Introduction
<-Project name-> is a website designed and engineered to smoothly allow users to adopt many different trees in their local area, which includes naming the tree, as well as giving the user lots of information about their tree such as soil quality, water consumption, carbon sequestration, oxygen production and more. The scope of our system is detailed below along with any assumptions made about other systems which our system will have to interact with.

### Scope of the System
Since our system is a website it will have many different tasks to accomplish, with some assumptions given to related systems to ensure our system cooperates nicely. These include:
- Tree statistics
- A Credit System
- Geographic Mapping
- Social Media
- Company cooperation
- Educational system
- Notifications
- Language differentiation

 Our credit system will allow users to set goals for themselves to improve their tree's health and get rewards in the form of credits for hitting certain goals which will incentivise them to look after their tree. These credits will be able to be used to redeem eco-friendly products such as reusable bags/bottles, energy-efficient lightbulbs etc, or they can be used to donate to an environmental charity from the list of verified charities available on the site.

Users will be able to find trees to adopt through a geographic mapping feature so they can see exactly where their tree is and what the surrounding area of it is like, as well as multiple recent pictures to visually see the health of the tree

The 'social media' aspect of our system will allow people can share their pictures of their tree as well as its statistics and their tree adoption stories. Users will be able to make a profile for their tree and will also be able to follow their friends’ trees as well as like and comment on their friends posts. This will increase engagement and discussion about each other's trees and their stories. There will also be a way to link their profile to other websites such as twitter and instagram, which may make more people see them and decide to adopt a tree of their own, which will further help improve the environment and local area. Forums may have a weekly chart with the intention to show off pinnacle donors. This healthful competition will inspire customers to donate greater in the direction of sustainability and create a positive impact.

Our system will work with companies by allowing them to adopt large areas of land to help offset their carbon emissions and help them strive towards being net carbon neutral. This would involve the company choosing a large area of land, such as a forest, and then paying for people to care for the trees in that area. Moreover, businesses can generously make contributions to promote sustainable improvement. A chart can be advanced that identifies organisations that contribute the most in the direction of sustainability. This will create honest opposition amongst businesses and inspire others to do the same.

Education is also in our best interests for this system and we will encourage local schools to adopt trees for the students to look after. This will hopefully make children excited about looking after trees as well as show them the importance of being environmentally friendly and looking after the environment.The system also stores some articles in its database that are available to users. Users are free to read them at any time and complete some quizzes. This will not only provide them with free information but also credits, which can later be redeemed.

Our notification system will send users reminders to look after their trees. These will come in many forms such as app based notifications, emails and texts. These will occur on an opt-in basis and will include things such as watering schedules for optimal water being given to trees, pruning guidelines to help improve tree health, advice for looking after their tree during extreme weather conditions and tips for caring after their adopted tree. On top of this, if people don’t adequately look after their tree, even after many notifications warning them, they may get it taken off them so someone else can adopt it and look after it instead.

Users will have the liberty to switch to any major language they wish at the click of a button, which will help the end user navigate our site easily and with more comfort, as well as developing a greater consumer-centric and inclusive experience that caters to a huge variety of linguistic diversity.
### Summary of the scope
In general, our system is a comprehensive digital platform that encourages users, businesses and organisations to engage in tree adoption and sponsorship to help accelerate the local area and planet towards hitting carbon net neutral, as well as help improve the local air quality. It provides tools for tree selection, educational resources, community engagement, and a rewards system to make tree adoption accessible and rewarding. With all of this we aim to significantly contribute to all of the global efforts to combat climate change and help make a difference to our planet for the better by making a more sustainable and greener environment for all of us to live and prosper in.
