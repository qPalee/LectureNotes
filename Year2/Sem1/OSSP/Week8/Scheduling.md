# Scheduling
Scheduling is needed because processes are competing for resources
It is an important OS function
Typically done through queues of processes waiting for a specific resource

### Process Scheduling Queues
Job queue - set of all processes in the system
Ready queue - set of all processes residing in the main memory
Device queues - set of processes waiting for an I/O device
Processes migrate amongst many different queues
