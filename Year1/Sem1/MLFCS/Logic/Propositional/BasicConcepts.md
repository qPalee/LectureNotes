<h1>Basic Concepts</h1>

<h2>Propositions</h2>
A **proposition** is a sentence which states a fact.
- A statement which can, in principle, be true or false

Examples:
- Birmingham is north of London
	Proposition, and true

- 8â‹…7=42
	Proposition and true

- Please mind the gap
	Not a proposition!

- Every natural number >2 is the sum of 2 primes
	Proposition, unknown if true or false

- Is black the opposite of white?
	Not a proposition

<h2>Arguments</h2>

An **argument** is a list of propositions
- The last is the **conclusion**
- and the others are called **premises**

An argument is **valid** whenever the premises are true, then so is the conclusion

**Example:**
Premise 1: If there is smoke, then there is a fire  
Premise 2: There is no fire  
Conclusion: Therefore, there is no smoke

In general, this is not valid:
1. If P then Q
2. Q
3. Therefore P
