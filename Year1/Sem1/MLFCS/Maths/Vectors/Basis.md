A set of vectors $v_1, v_2, ..., v_n \in V$ forms a **basis** if:
- $Span(v_1, v_2, ..., v_n) = V$
	That is, every vector in V can be represented as a linear combination of the given vectors
	If $Span(v_1, v_2, ..., v_n) = V$ then the set of vectors $v_1, v_2, ..., v_n \in V$ is a **spanning set**

- The set of vectors v_1, v_2, ..., v_n is linearly independent
