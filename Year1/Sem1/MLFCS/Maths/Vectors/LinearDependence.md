A set of vectors $\vec{v_1}, \vec{v_2}, ..., \vec{v_n} \in V$ is **linearly independent** iff 
$$Span(\vec{v_1}, \vec{v_2}, ..., \vec{v_n}) = \vec{0} \text{ AND } r_1 = r_2 = ... = r_n = 0$$
In other words, it must be 0 without all scalars being 0, meaning $\exists r_p.Span(v_1, v_2, ..., v_n) = 0 \land r_p \neq 0, p \leq n$

Otherwise, it is linearly depenedant
