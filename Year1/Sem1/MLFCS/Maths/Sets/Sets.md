Sets are a collection of objects
Sets are written in braces {}
You use $\in$ to indicate when something is a member of a set
-> $A \in$ {x, y, z}
2 sets A and B are equal when they have the same elements
In sets, order and repetition are ingored

Every set is either finite or infinite
Finite set : {3, 4, 7}
Infinite set: Natural number, real numbers

Every finite set has a cardinality (size) which is a natural number
A finite set can be enumerated, in principle

### How to write a set

- Enumerate the elements
- Use ellipse (...) -> Informal, only use when obvious
- [[SetBuilderNotation]]

### Multplying Sets
Given sets A, B
A x B = {$(a, b) \, | \, a \in A, b \in B$} 
You distribute out the sets:
{a, b, c} x (x, y) = {(a, x), (a, y), (b, x), (b, y), (c, x), (c, y)}

In programming, a type that corresponds to a product of sets is called a "record type"

### Applications of sets in CS
Types can be modelled using sets
- int can be badly modelled using the set of integers, or better using the set of $[-2^{31}, 2^{31})$
Databases
Algorithmic problems
Autometa, i.e sets of states

##### Set theory was invented by Georg Cantor in the 19th century

Finite sets have a cardinality
	What about infinite sets?

Multiplication of natural numbers is associative
	What about multiplication of sets? (No)

is there a "universal set"?
	A set containing absolutely everything
