The function f:$A \rightarrow B$  is said to be **one-to one** (injective) under the followning conditions

$\forall \space x, y \in A, \space f(x) = f(y) \implies x = y$ 

$f: \mathbb{R} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$
$x \rightarrow kx, k \in \mathbb{R}$ 
Its injective iff $k \neq 0$ 
If k=0, it is **not** injective

Let f be a strictly increasing function
**Get off sheets**

A function $f: A \rightarrow B$ is subjective when every b

The range is the codomain

Given two finite sets A and B, theres an injection from A to B iff card A $\leq$ card B

There's a surjection iff *card B  $\leq$ card A and B is nonempty or they're both empty

Lets take some element p of B
|A| = n+k, |B| = n
$\therefore |A| \geq |B|$

Take the fucntion that sends:
$A_i \rightarrow B_i$
$A_j \rightarrow B_1 \forall j \geq n$
