{$n \in \text{Natural Numbers } | \, n^3 \geq 100$}

Sometimes we use an operation:
{$n^2 \, | \, n \in \text{Natural Numbers,} \, n^3 \geq 100$}

Ordered Pairs
(a, b) = (x, y) $\iff$ a=x and b=y

Ordered Triplets
(a, b, c) = (x, y, z) $\iff$ a=x, b=y, c=z

This can be done for any ordered list
There is just one 0-tuple -> ()
() = () $\iff \top$
