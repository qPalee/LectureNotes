Given a [[Sets]] B,
A **subset** of B is a set A such that every element of A is in B
A $\subseteq$ B

For any set A, $A \subseteq A$

For 2 sets A, B
$A=B \iff A \subseteq \text{B and B} \subseteq A$

The union is the set of things taht are either in A or B, $A \cup B$
The intersection is the set of things that are in A and B, $A \cap B$
$A \setminus B$ is the set of things in A but not B

"Or" means inclusive or, i.e and/or

The natural numbers are thought of as a subset of integers
