A relation from A to a set B is a subset of A x B

A function from A to B is a relation from A to B such that each element of A has a unique image
- Say A has size 3 and B has size 10
- How many functions are there from A to B?
- There are $10^3$ functions

If A has size m, B has size n
There are $n^m$ functions from A to B

We write $B^A$ for the set of all function going from A to B

f: $A \rightarrow B$ means f is a function from A to B
$f \subseteq B^A$

A is domain, B is codomain
**Look at sheets for this bit**

f: (x, y, z) $\rightarrow$ (x + y) + z
f: N x  N x N $\rightarrow$ N

An endorelation on a set A is a relation from A to A
An endofunction on a set A is a function from A to A

Given a relation R from A to B and S going from B to C,
the composite relation from A to C

Given a function f: A to B and and g: B to C,
the composite function is A to C

g.f: x $\rightarrow$ g(f(x))

Given a relation R from A to B, the converse (opposite) relation (funky symbol) goes from B to A

Given a relation R from A to B, any subset x of A has a forwards image $R[x]$ 

Any subset Y of B has an inverse image $R^{-1}[y]$

$A^\emptyset$ = {empty function} = $\emptyset$

A relation is a set of ordered pairs
