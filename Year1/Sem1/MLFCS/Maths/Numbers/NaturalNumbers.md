<h1>Natural Numbers</h1>

Used to answer:
- How many? - Cardinal number
- Which one? - Exclusive/Inclusive

In an array, Natural Numbers are used as ordinals.

All natural numbers can be expressed used 0 and S (successor)
This is unary notation.
Very natural from a conceptual viewpoint
**Very inefficient**

Position noation - using a number base (Base 2, Base 10, Base 16)
Base 10 used because we have 10 fingers
Compters don't have 10 fingers -> so it used binary

Base can be any positive integer > 1

For any natural numbers {a, b}, where b > 0,
There are unique numbers m and r where (r < b)
a=mb + r
