$$I = \begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\ 0 & 1 \end{pmatrix}$$
Let A be any 2x2 matrix over the field of rational numbers
AI = A = IA
$\implies$ I x A = A -> Same as 1 for numeric multiplication

I can also exist in a 3x3 matrix:
$I = \begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 1 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 1 \end{pmatrix}$
I x A = A still holds with this 3x3 matrix
