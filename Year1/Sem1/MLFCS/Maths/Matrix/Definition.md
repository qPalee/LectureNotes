A matrix is a two-dimensional array whose entries come from a field
We can read it either row-wise or column-wise

The size of a matrix (number of entries) is the number of rows times the number of columns
- A matrix with 2 rows and 3 colums would be a 2x3 matrix
$a_{2 \text{x} 3} = \begin{pmatrix} a_1 & a_2 & a_3 \\ b_1 & b_2 & b_3 \end{pmatrix}$ 

$\forall \, m, n \geq 1$, matrix (m x n) is a vector space
