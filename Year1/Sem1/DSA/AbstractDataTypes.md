A type is:

- A set of possible values

- with a set of allowed operations on those values

ADT is a type whose internal representation is hidden to the user

Users of an ADT may have no info on how the ADT is implemented, so depends only on the published info about how it behaves.

Implementation of an abstract type can be changed without having to change the code that uses it, as long as it still uses the same interface.
