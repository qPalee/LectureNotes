In graphs, any node can be connected to any other node with no restrictions
Graphs can be weighted, usually with positive integers
Graphs can also be directional, so pointer can have a direction or not

### Concepts
- In Maths, the term vertex is used, however we use both Node and Vertex interchangeably
- If the graph is undirected, it can be though of as two seperate directed node each way. 
	$u - w = u \rightarrow w \land w \rightarrow u$
- A directed graph is often called a **Digraph** 
- A graph is simple if:
	- It has no self loops
	- It has no more than one edge between any pair of nodes
- A path is a sequence of vertices $v_1, v_2, ..., v_n$ where $v_i$ and $v_{i+1}$ are connected for all
	$1 \leq i \leq n-1$
- A cycle is a non-empty path whose first vertex is the same as its last vertex.
