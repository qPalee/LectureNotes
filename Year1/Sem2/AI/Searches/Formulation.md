The formulation of a search problem is the process of formally defining the search problem

We make the following assumptions about the environment:
- Observable - Agent able to know urrent state
- Discrete - Finite many actions
- Known - The agent can determine which states are reached by which action
- Deterministic - Each action has one outcome

Under these assumptions, the solution to any problem is a fixed sequence of actions. More formally, the solution to a search problem is the sequence of actions from the initial state to the goal state  

The agentâ€™s task is to find out how to act, now and in the future, in order to reach a goal state: namely to determine a sequence of actions  

The process of looking for a sequence of actions is called **search**

Formally, a search problem is defined by the following five components:
- Initial State - the state the agent starts in
- Actions - the set describing the actions that can be executed in any state s
- Transition Model - a description of what each action does
- Goal Test - determines if a state is a goal state
- Path Cost - function that assigns a cost to each path

The first 3 define the state space of the problem, in the form of a graph/network
A path in the state space is a sequence of states connected by a sequence of actions
