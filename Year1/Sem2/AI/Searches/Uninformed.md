An uninformed search (blind search) is defined as the set of strategies having no additional information about states beyond that provided in the problem formulation.

Uninformed search strategies can only generate successors and distinguish a goal state from a non-goal state

The key difference between two uninformed search strategies is the order in which nodes are expanded
